# Fine-tuning Prithvi Models with TerraTorch

This guide provides a sample workflow for fine-tuning **Prithvi** models using **TerraTorch**.

---

## 1. Installation

### 1.1 Install Python
Make sure you have **Python 3.12+** installed on your system.  
You can verify your version with:
```bash
python --version
```

### 1.2 Install `uv`
`uv` is a fast Python package manager.

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 1.3 Sync the Environment
Once `uv` is installed, synchronize your project dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will create or update your virtual environment based on the project configuration (e.g., `pyproject.toml`).

---

✅ **Next Steps**
- Configure your dataset paths in example.py.
- Start the fine-tuning script.
- Evaluate and visualize the model outputs.
